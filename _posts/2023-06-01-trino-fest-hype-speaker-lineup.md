Trino Fest is just around the corner! We're only two weeks away, and we're
excited to share that we've got an incredible speaker lineup with a wide variety
of talks about all things Trino. If you're out of the loop,
[we announced Trino Fest](/2023-04-05-announcing-trino-fest-2023.html) back in
April as a two-day, free, virtual event. If you want to attend, see talks live,
and engage with our speakers in Q&As at the end of each session,
[go register now](https://www.starburst.io/info/trinofest/)! You do need to
register to view the event, so don't delay.

With that said, we're also excited to bring you a preview of our exciting
speaker lineup. Read on if you'd like to learn more.

## New connectors

We've got two talks, one from Bloomberg and ForePaaS and another from Redis,
about ongoing efforts to extend Trino's functionality to query even more data
sources. Erik Anderson from Bloomberg and Yu Teng from ForePaaS will talk about
their shared need for a Snowflake connector and the collaboration to get their
two connectors merged and then merged into Trino. Allen Terleto and Julien Ruaux
at Redis will be talking about a new, custom, and improved Redis connector for
Trino, showing how you can leverage the speed of both Redis and Trino to run
queries faster than ever while seamlessly integrating with data visualization
frameworks.

## The Python ecosystem

We've got talks from [Fugue](https://github.com/fugue-project/fugue) and
[Ibis](https://ibis-project.org/), two different tools that integrate Python
with SQL, and then run that SQL on underlying data sources. Both have recently
added Trino support, and they're excited to share their use cases and introduce
the Trino community to the new, powerful ways you can leverage it. Trino has
always been a SQL query engine, but with Fugue and Ibis, writing Python code to
run queries with Trino is suddenly a reality, and analysts and data scientists
may not even need to know much SQL to get the insights they're looking for.

## Data lakes

Ryan Blue, the co-founder of Iceberg founder of Tabular, will be exploring how
to best write CDC (change data capture) streams into Iceberg tables. A talk from
Kevin Liu at Stripe will explore how a data engineer can monitor queries being
run on Iceberg to catch performance outliers and understand usage rates. A talk
from Alluxio highlights caching optimizations with Trino and data lakes.
OneHouse is giving a talk about using Trino with Hudi, exploring how to get
query latency down, how multi-modal indexing works in Hudi, and how Trino can
utilize that indexing to execute queries at astonishing speeds. A lightning talk
from Comcast will explore Hive views, and DuneSQL will be discussing its use of
Trino with Delta Lake, rounding out coverage on all four of Trino's lakehouse
connectors.

## And more!

We'll hear from customers of Trino's main commercial vendors - Datto will be
discussing their use of Starburst Galaxy, and Arctic Wolf will give an overview
of how AWS Athena helps them provide data to customers. Jan Was from Starburst
has a lightning talk on avoiding the costs of BI tools or expensive
visualization software by setting things up for free with GitHub Actions. And
Walmart has a talk on finding ways to cut costs with cloud storage, rounding out
our expansive lineup.

Does any of that sound exciting?
