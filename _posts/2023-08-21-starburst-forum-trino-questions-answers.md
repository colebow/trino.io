Last week, one of Trino's main sponsors,[Starburst](https://www.starburst.io/),
[announced the launch of a community forum](https://www.starburst.io/blog/starburst-community-forum/)
with a [Trino category](https://www.starburst.io/community/forum/c/trino).
Here in the Trino space, we're excited about the announcement, as it means that
there will be a dedicated, easy-to-search site for knowledge-sharing and having
your Trino questions answered. The Trino [Slack]({{site.url}}/slack.html) (also
sponsored by Starburst) has been the key solution for community discussion and
questions for a while, but with the friction of needing to sign up and Slack's
notoriously poor search functionality limiting discoverability of past
conversations, it's never been the ideal way to spread information. With a
[Discourse-powered](https://www.discourse.org/) forum tailored to Trino
knowledge, we're excited that the Trino community will have a better, more
discoverable resource to learn from each other and use the world's best query
engine better than ever before.

Sound good? [Go check out the forum!](https://www.starburst.io/community/forum/c/trino/7)

How do you use the forum? For starters, the Trino and Starburst developer
relations team is consistently posting content and highlights from the Trino
Slack, so you can check in and see the questions and answers that have been
added without even needing to log in. But if you ever have a question about
Trino, sign up and ask away! If your question has been asked before, Discourse
will helpfully suggest similar topics and surface that for you before you post,
so there's no need to worry about redundant questions. Then it's just a matter
of waiting for an answer. Beyond that, if you've ever got something to show off,
there's a [specific category for showcasing your work](https://www.starburst.io/community/forum/c/showcase/25).

Sounds simple and easy, right? That's because it is! But in order for a site
dedicated to community knowledge to take off, it needs the community to adopt
it. We're hoping that Trino users everywhere can keep it in mind and use it when
it makes sense, as once the ball gets rolling, it has the potential to be the
most useful and discoverable trove of Trino community knowledge out there.
