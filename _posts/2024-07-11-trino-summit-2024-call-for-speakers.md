Fresh off the heels of [Trino Fest 2024]({% post_url 2024-06-24-trino-fest-recap
%}), where Commander Bun Bun was busy meeting the Trino community in-person,
we're already looking forward to another, bigger event to round out the year in
Trino. For those who've been here a while, you know that can only mean one
thing: Trino Summit 2024. Much like last year, it will be a two-day, fully
virtual event, hosting a wide range of talks covering all things Trino on the
11th and 12th of December. Read on for more info, or if you're already
convinced...

## Join us online

Trino Summit is an event that brings together engineers, analysts, data
scientists, and anyone else interested in using or contributing to Trino. As the
biggest Trino event of the year, we're excited to bring together professionals
from the big data and analytics community, so they can share experiences and
insights, make connections, and learn from each other.

The event will be broadcast live, and speakers will be addressing questions
asked in chat, so if you want the full experience, make sure to register and
attend while the talks are happening. Even if you can't make it, registering
means you'll be notified when we post videos of all talks to the Trino YouTube
channel after the event, [so don't fret - sign up!](https://www.starburst.io/info/trino-summit-2024/?utm_medium=trino&utm_source=website&[…]Y25-Q4-CM-Trino-Summit-2024-IMC-Upgrade&utm_content=CFS-Blog)

## Call for speakers

Interested in speaking? We want to hear from everyone in the Trino community
who has something to share. We are looking for full sessions (about 30 minutes)
and lightning talks (15 minutes). We welcome beginner to highly advanced
submissions for talks that are connected to Trino.

A two-day event means we've got room for everything, so if you're unsure about
whether to submit a talk, go ahead and do it! We'll review all submissions, and
we'll do our best to work with you to turn your talk into a smash hit. Some
possible topics include:

* Best practices and use cases
* Data lake, lakehouse, and data federation architectures
* Query federation and data migrations
* Table formats, file formats, and metadata catalogs
* Optimizations and performance improvements
* Data engineering, including data cleaning, batch and streaming architectures,
  and maintenance
