After the resounding success of Trino Fest and Trino Summit in 2023, Commander
Bun Bun has exciting news to share: we're taking our biggest events of the year
back to being in-person. They'll be hybrid, to be more specific, so if you can't
travel, don't fret, you'll still be able to watch and ask questions in chat.
But if you can travel, you won't want to miss out! Everything you already know
and love about Trino Fest is moving to the East Coast for the lovely Boston
summer. The event is on the 13th of June in the Hyatt Regency Boston, where
we'll have a full day of talks, time to network, and a happy hour at the end of
the day. You may even get to meet Commander Bun Bun, who's ditching the hiking
gear in favor of training for the Olympics. Sound exciting?

## <a name="tcc"/> Trino contributor congregation

The day after Trino Fest, we'll also be hosting an in-person meetup for
Trino contributors and engineers to catch up, discuss the Trino roadmap, and
engage directly with the maintainers in-person. It's a great opportunity to put
faces and voices to those GitHub handles, align on the big ideas or tricky PRs
that have been moving slowly, and find more ways to get involved in Trino
development. If you're interested in attending, message Manfred Moser or Cole
Bowden on the [Trino Slack]({{site.url}}/slack.html), and we'll get you added to
the attendee list and share more details.

## Sponsor Trino Fest

Starburst is the organizing sponsor of the event, but to make Trino Fest a
smashing success, they're excited and interested in collaborating with other
organizations within the community. If you are interested in sponsoring, email
[events@starburstdata.com](mailto:events@starburstdata.com) for information.

And regardless of whether you're planning on attending, speaking, or sponsoring,
we look forward to seeing you soon!
