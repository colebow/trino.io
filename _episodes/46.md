## Introducing the Ignite connector to Trino

The [Trino Ignite connector](https://trino.io/docs/current/connector/ignite.html)
was added a couple releases ago in Trino 408. It's not every day that we add a
new connector to Trino, and so the topic of today's episode is exploring the
connector, what it does, and what its use cases are. After that, we are going
to talk about the process of coming in as an outside engineer and contributing 
an entirely new connector to Trino.

## What is Ignite?

Apache Ignite is an in-memory distributed database, comparable to others you may
be familiar with like Redis and SingleStore. If you're not familiar with them or 
with in-memory computing, the gist is that by focusing on using RAM instead of
disk storage, you can create a database system which is *much* faster - the
Ignite website advertises 10-1000x improvements. Of course, this is more
expensive, too, so it thrives in settings where performance is critical. 

With an initial release 7 years ago, Ignite is still a relative newcomer among
in-memory databases, coming with modern bells and whistles that has it
positioned to become a successor to those other, comparable databases mentioned
above. It also has some key functionality that sets it apart, including a
fully-distributed architecture which can use disk storage, allowing it to scale
horizontally.

## Contributing the Ignite connector

The Trino community and developers try their best to be active reviewers,
collaborators, and participants on pull requests coming in from outside
contributors. Massive contributions like the Ignite connector can take a lot of
round trips, back-and-forth discussion, and work from both the contributor and
the project's maintainers to get it into a state where it is ready to merge and
go live for users to try out.

To give you an idea,
[the pull request (PR) to contribute Ignite](https://github.com/trinodb/trino/pull/8323)
was opened in mid-June, 2021. It received immediate feedback from a couple
maintainers, went through a few round trips with amendments, re-reviews, more
edits, and then other reviews. But in an open source environment, each round
trip can tend to take longer and longer. Progress stalled in November 2021, and
neither Jason nor the maintainers poked the Ignite PR for nearly a year. In
October 2022, as part of Trino DevRel's roundup of stale and out-of-date pull
requests, we bumped back into the work that Jason had done. The wheels began to
turn again, starting slow but picking up the pace, until it returned to full and
active development, with several maintainers checking in frequently until the
connector was ready to go. But that's the story from an observer, and we've got
Jason here to go into more detail.

### Questions for Jason

* How was the Trino review process?
* Were there any major lessons you picked up along the way?
* What tips would you give to someone else looking to add something into Trino?

## PR of the episode: #13493: Add support for `migrate` procedure in Iceberg

If you've been in the data space for a while, you may know that there's a bit of
a prevailing current in migrating from Hive to Iceberg. Out with the old, in
with the new, and in with the performance gains. [Yuya Ebihara](https://github.com/ebyhr),
one of the Trino maintainers,
[has added a table procedure to Trino's Iceberg connector](https://github.com/trinodb/trino/pull/13493)
to make that process much, much simpler. Rather than a slow, manual, and arduous
process, if you have a Hive table stored in a file format supported by Iceberg,
it's now as simple as calling the `migrate` table procedure and letting it run.
The procedure copies the schema, partitioning, properties, and location of the
source table, then streams in all the data files from the source table to
re-build it all in the Iceberg format. Neat, right?
