## Introducing the two new Trino maintainers

Manfred should hardly need an introduction to Trino Community Broadcast viewers,
as he's been around and hosting episodes from the beginning, and authored
[Trino: The Definitive Guide](https://www.starburst.io/info/oreilly-trino-guide/).
In the background, he's also been quietly working on docs, the website, and
a wide variety of other initiatives in the Trino community.

James should also be familiar to anyone who has contributed on Trino. Iconically
rocking a GitHub avatar of the face of
[Bob Ross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Ross), it's hard to miss when he
shows up on a pull request. And working on Trino as part of
[AWS Athena](https://aws.amazon.com/athena/), he's been a major engineering
contributor for the last several years, with 262 commits under his belt and more
on the way.

## What is a maintainer?

If you don't go clicking around on the Trino website fanatically trying to find
everything you can possibly read about the project, there's a chance you've
never bumped into our [roles]({{site.url}}/development/roles.html) page,
which highlights how Trino is governed. To quote that page:

> In Trino, maintainer is an active role. A maintainer is responsible for
> merging code only after ensuring it has been reviewed thoroughly and aligns with
> the Trino vision and guidelines. In addition to merging code, a maintainer
> actively participates in discussions and reviews. Being a maintainer does not
> grant additional rights in the project to make changes, set direction, or
> anything else that does not align with the direction of the project. Instead, a
> maintainer is expected to bring these to the project participants as needed to
> gain consensus. The maintainer role is for an individual, so if a maintainer
> changes employers, the role is retained. However, if a maintainer is no longer
> actively involved in the project, their maintainer status will be reviewed.

Or, in normal speech, a maintainer is a trusted individual with merge rights.
But with great power comes great responsibility, higher standards, and an
expectation to be an active steward of the Trino project. It's not easy to
become a maintainer - prior to Manfred and James, it had been over a year since
the most recent maintainer was appointed. The high bar of activity, quality, and
attitude is not trivial by any stretch, and so we're excited to talk to them
about the role, how they got here, and what they're looking forward to for the
future of Trino.

## The path to becoming a maintainer

### Manfred

* When did you first start working on Trino?
* What's your proudest contribution to the project?
* Have a funny story you've wanted to share to the world?

### James

* When did you first start working on Trino?
* What's your proudest contribution to the project?
* Why the Bob Ross avatar?

## PR of the episode: [16753: Improve TopN row number / rank performance](https://github.com/trinodb/trino/pull/16753)

We normally focus on flashy and user-facing PRs for the PR of the episode, but
this week, courtesy of our guest James, we're going to highlight something that
better represents the more routine work that's going on in Trino all the time:
a performance improvement.

## Trino events

[Trino Fest](https://www.starburst.io/info/trinofest/) is coming up in just a
couple months. Register to attend or
[sign up to submit a talk](https://sessionize.com/trino-fest-2023) if you have
something to share!

If you have an event that is related to Trino, let us know so we can add it to
the [Trino events calendar]({{site.url}}/community.html#events). Kevin Haley's
[Getting to Know Trino](https://www.meetup.com/boston-data-engineering/events/291662797/)
in Boston was a great success, and we'd love to hear from other Trino community 
members who'd be interested in hosting other events!
