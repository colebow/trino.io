## Concept of the episode: 50!

No, that's not a factorial, we're just excited to have made it to 50 Trino
Community Broadcast episodes. We've brought back some familiar faces to talk
about what we've done, how we've got here, what it takes to keep an open source
project ticking for over a decade, and celebrate the steps we've taken along
the way. It's unscripted, and the discussion carries to wherever it feels like.

Tune in to hear about the history of the Trino Community Broadcast, the upcoming
Snowflake connector, and a few of the core philosophies that have kept Trino
running. Manfred also shows off updates to the Trino website, highlighting all
the tools, data sources, and add-ons that you can use with Trino.

## Trino events

Trino Fest was a little over a month ago, and we're publishing the last recap of
all the talks to the Trino blog today! Check out our YouTube channel and the
Trino website to catch up on everything you missed.
