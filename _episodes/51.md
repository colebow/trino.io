## Concept of the episode: PopSQL

It may be familiar to some of our viewers to describe an environment where
key queries and dashboards are buried in someone's personal workspace, and you
have to go ask them directly every time you want to check on your metrics.
When you're running a world-class, highly-performant query engine like Trino and
investing time and resources into maintaining it, shouldn't you treat your
queries like a first-class, collaborative, versioned system, too?

[PopSQL](https://popsql.com/), a playful spin on the word popsicle, solves the
sadness that is disorganized and siloed insights by centralizing queries into a
platform that has versioning, security, and a suite of collaborative tools
comparable to Google Drive. Want to work with your teammate on a query? You can
open up the same editor and see the same thing. Want to see what that query
someone ran last week was to see how the new feature is doing? It's there. Have
a suggestion to improve something? Leave a comment. Realize your suggestion was
wrong and need to undo the change? You can view past versions of the query.

PopSQL and Trino make sense together. PopSQL provides a best-in-class interface
for organizing, collaborating, and working together on all of your SQL queries
across the business, and Trino handles running those queries at unparalleled
speeds. They go hand-in-hand for treating your data and SQL analytics as first
class citizens. In today's episode, we'll be exploring what PopSQL is, how it
integrates with Trino, and how the engineers at PopSQL have done some cool
things with Trino to make the integration better than ever before. We'll start
with that last one, actually.

## Concept of the episode: A new Node.js adapter for Trino

Trino in the frontend is... a tricky thing. We can go ahead and admit that the
[Trino web UI](/docs/current/admin/web-interface.html) isn't going to win any
awards for design or functionality. And while a couple Node-based libraries
exist out there, including [presto-client-node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/presto-client)
and [lento](https://github.com/vweevers/lento). But presto-client-node lacked
support for streaming and had some issues handling 500 errors, and lento doesn't
quite support Trino out of the box and only supports single streams, which
wasn't ideal for PopSQL's distributed architecture. So when PopSQl's engineers
went to build their frontend and integrate with Trino, what did they do? Build
their own adapter.

We'll talk about how it was implemented, what key features it unlocks, and why
it makes using PopSQL with Trino an even better experience.

## Demo of the episode: Using PopSQL with Trino

It's hard to write show notes for a demo, because you can't really experience
the demo by reading about what's happening. But as a surface-level overview,
we'll be going over:

* Setting up a connection
* The schema explorer
* The SQL editor
* Query scheduling

## PR of the episode: #57 on trino-gateway: Release version 3

Last week, the community officially released the
[trino-gateway](https://github.com/trinodb/trino-gateway), a proxy and load
balancer that enables large operations to run multiple Trino clusters in
harmony with each other to serve big queries and small queries alike. If you or
your organization have a need for more than one Trino cluster and want the
seamless experience of being able to connect to any of them through a single
interface, then check it out! It's the product of many months of effort and
should be a fantastic solution for running Trino at the absolute largest scales.

## Rounding out

Trino Summit, the biggest Trino event of the year, is coming up on the 13th and
14th of December, and like Trino Fest, it'll be fully virtual. If you'd like to
give a talk about anything related to Trino, we're looking for speakers now.
[Submit your talk here!](https://sessionize.com/trino-summit-2023/) If you'd
rather attend, you can also
[go register to attend now](https://www.starburst.io/info/trinosummit2023/?utm_source=trino&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=NORAM-FY24-Q4-EV-Trino-Summit-2023&utm_content=tcb).

Prior to Trino Summit, if you'd like to learn about SQL from the absolute
experts, we've also announced the [Trino Training Series](/blog/2023/09/27/training-series)
that we'll be running as a buildup to the summit. Register now and look forward
to four great sessions starting from the ground up and ending with some key
tricks and Trino specifics that even a seasoned SQL veteran may not know about.

O'Reilly. You can download
