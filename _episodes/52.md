## Concept of the episode: JDBC-based connectors

In Trino, we have a lot of connectors that are based on top of JDBC. JDBC could
stand for "just da best connectors," but it's really Java database connectivity,
and it's one of the core APIs by which many of the most prominent connectors in
the Trino ecosystem function. It's so common, in fact, that we have
[an example JDBC connector in Trino](/docs/current/develop/example-jdbc.html) to
make it easier to go implement your own JDBC-based connector if you need one.

## Concept of the episode: YugabyteDB

But if the topic of today's episode is YugabyteDB, why are we talking about
PostgreSQL? Well, if you're unfamiliar with Yugabyte, lifting from
[their docs](https://docs.yugabyte.com/): "YugabyteDB is distributed PostgreSQL
that delivers on-demand scale, built-in resilience, and a multi-API interface."
Distributed architecture should be a familiar concept to a community involved
with a distributed query engine, and if you understand how Trino is able to
leverage it, you should also understand why it makes sense to pair with
Yugabyte. We'll be discussing why Yugabyte got started, what it does differently
from other databases, what it does better than other databases, and how you
might want to use it with Trino.

## Demo of the episode: Trino on YugabyteDB

As part of the episode, we'll also be showing off how you can use YugabyteDB 
with Trino. We start with using the PostgreSQL connector, then Denis shows how 
to use the PostgreSQL connector to run Trino with Yugabyte. It's always hard to
explain demos in show notes, so tune into the YouTube video and take a look for
yourself if you're curious!

## Rounding out

Trino Summit, the biggest Trino event of the year, is coming up on the 13th and
14th of December, and like Trino Fest, it'll be fully virtual. If you'd like to
give a talk about anything related to Trino, we're looking for speakers now.
[Submit your talk here!](https://sessionize.com/trino-summit-2023/) If you'd
rather attend, you can also
[go register to attend now](https://www.starburst.io/info/trinosummit2023/?utm_source=trino&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=NORAM-FY24-Q4-EV-Trino-Summit-2023&utm_content=tcb).

Prior to Trino Summit, if you'd like to learn about SQL from the absolute
experts, we've also gotten started with the
[Trino Training Series]({{site.baseurl}}/blog/2023/09/27/training-series)
that we'll be running as a buildup to the summit. The
[recap for the first session]({{site.baseurl}}/blog/2023/10/18/sql-training-1)
is live, but there's three more to come! Register now and look forward
to those great sessions starting from the ground up and ending with some key
tricks and Trino specifics that even a seasoned SQL veteran may not know about.

We also have a talk about Trino on Ice and data meshes coming up in Redwood City
with Slalom and Starburst. If you're local, consider
[signing up and checking it out!](https://go.slalom.com/starburstnorcal)
